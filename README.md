# Overview

This repo contains control code for the Scrubcam, an edge-AI-enabled
field wildlife camera system.

# Hardware

The target hardware is a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B single board computer
with a Picamera-style camera, a Google Coral USB Accelerator, and the
AdaFruit PiTFT screen (2.8" resistive touch model with 4
GPIO-connected buttons) attached. Typically several storage devices
are connected via the USB ports on the Pi (e.g. uSD card
readers). This hardware is typically integrated into a larger assembly
that includes a weatherproof enclosure and batteries and--in some
variants--a charger controller with external solar panels.
